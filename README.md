# DataAnalysis_Plastic_Pollution_NorthAmerica_

Description: The project focuses on addressing the issue of plastic pollution in North America through comprehensive data analysis and modeling techniques.

Abstract:
Plastic pollution poses a significant threat to marine life and human health. This project provides a detailed analysis of plastic waste in North America, utilizing a dataset comprising information on product attributes such as brand name, parent company, material type, and geographical location. Through extensive data preparation and exploratory data analysis techniques, insights into the distribution of plastic materials and their contributing sources are unveiled. Logistic regression and random forest models are employed to predict the presence of plastic waste based on product attributes, offering valuable insights for mitigating the environmental impact of plastic pollution. Interactive dashboards provide visual presentations of the data, highlighting the contribution of parent companies to plastic waste and the geographical distribution of contaminants. The findings underscore the necessity for concerted efforts in reducing plastic pollution through awareness, policy advocacy, and sustainable alternatives.
